    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The State of the Union address is an annual address given by the President of the United States in which the President outlines the agenda he has for the country. We are curious whether exploring these addresses tell us anything interesting such as change of the English language over time and thus conducted some text processing to these speeches. We found that over time, while these addresses have used more sentences, these sentences are shorter in nature. Furthermore, presidents from around the same era have very similar speech patterns, an indication that these speeches do in fact reflect the change of the English language over time. The two current major parties, the Democrat Party and the Republican Party, have followed similar trends in their speech chracteristics, and both showed interest in the economy. "

    "## 1. Overview of Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset could be easily seperated into the individual speeches, as each speech is separated by three asterisks. This dataset of speeches contain **227** addresses delivered by **42** US Presidents from 1934 to 2017. Interestingly but unsurprisingly, most speeches occurred at the end of a year or the commencement of a new year possibly in order to address the goals of the new year. Even though there are 45 presidents, there are only a total of 42 presidents in this dataset. The missing presidents are: William Henry Harrison, who passed away one month into his presidency and James A. Garfield, who was assassinated in his first year. Thus they were not able to deliver addresses. Grover Cleveland counts as 2 presidents because he was elected in two non-consecutive terms."

    "- `n_sent`: number of sentences in the speech\n",
    "- `n_words_all`: number of words in the speech, including stop words or punctuations\n",
    "- `n_words`: number of words in the speech, excluding stop words and punctuations\n",
    "- `n_uwords`: number of *unique* words in the speech, excluding stop words and punctuations\n",
    "- `n_swords`: number of *unique, stemmed* words in the speech, excluding stop words and punctuations\n",
    "- `n_chars`: number of letters in the speech\n",
    "---\n",
    "- `logn_words`: number of words on a logarithmic scale, for plotting purpose\n",
    "- `logn_sent`: number of sentences on a logarithmic scale, for plotting purpose\n",

    "- `vocab_per_word`: vocabulary size per word\n",
    "- `word_per_sent`: average sentence length\n",

    "**Jimmy Carter** gave the longest speech in 1981 with 21041 words while **George Washington** gave the shortest speech in 1790 with 538 words. When Carter took presidency, the United States was facing a lot of problems: From international problems such as the Cold War and the Iran hostage crisis to domestic problems such as the recovering economy, Carter had a lot to talk about. Meanwhile, Washington's was the first state of the union ever delivered, so it makes sense for it to be the shortest. "

    "## 3. Words matrix\n",
    "We ran through the 227 speeches to count the frequency of unique words and got the following matrix. wmat is comprised of 93.26% zeros. Not only do we keep numbers in the speeches, but also the English language is constantly evolving. The words used by George Washington will differ significantly from the words used by Donald Trump. We saw this in the previous part."

The economy term did not have that high of a mean mentions, which implies that the presidents go more into detail about statistics such as unemployment."
